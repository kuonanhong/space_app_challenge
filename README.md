## Challenge
### [Every Cloud](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/warning-danger-ahead/every-cloud/details)
Map severe weather conditions with the presence of local atmospheric aerosols to identify potential connections!

## Solution
We created a platform to display [NEO](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/ftp.php) data and events from other sources.

## Results

For example, we can display the aerosol data, rain data and volcano eruption events during 2011 all together. The results looks like the following video.
