# 2017 Nasa Space Challenge Hackathon

## Challenge
### [Every Cloud](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/warning-danger-ahead/every-cloud/details)
Map severe weather conditions with the presence of local atmospheric aerosols to identify potential connections!

## Solution
We created a platform to display [NEO](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/ftp.php) data and events from other sources.

For Example, we display the aeroso and rain data from NEO and Volcano eruption events. The results looks like the following video.
