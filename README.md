## Challenge
### [Every Cloud](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/warning-danger-ahead/every-cloud/details)
Map severe weather conditions with the presence of local atmospheric aerosols to identify potential connections!

## Solution
We created a platform to display [NEO](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/ftp.php) data and events from other sources.

## Example
#### Data Layer 1: The observed event data (volcanic eruption in this case)
- Create a KML file with event. Mark the timestamp and location of the event with an icon. In this case, we used **volcanic eruption** as the observed event.
-  Download the volcanic eruption data from [The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP)](http://volcano.si.edu/gvp_about.cfm) for all volcanic eruption in 2011. 
- volcano2011.kml file contains all volcanic eruption data in 2011 with latitude and longitude infomation in **coordinates** elements, volcano name in **name** tag and specify the placemark icon in **styleUrl** as a volcano to visualize on Google Earth. To visualize and observe the impact of volcanic eruption, we used **TimeSpan** to show 6-8 month period of time after a volcanic eruption.

```
<Placemark>
	<name>Grimsvotn</name>
   		<gx:TimeSpan>
           <begin>2011-05-21</begin>
           <end>2012-02-15</end>
       </gx:TimeSpan>
       <styleUrl>#volcano</styleUrl>
       <Point>
           <gx:drawOrder>1</gx:drawOrder>
           <coordinates>-17.316,64.416,0</coordinates>
       </Point>
</Placemark>
```

#### Data Layer 2: Aerosol Optical Thickness and Rainfall data from NASA
- Download aerosol optical thickness data from [NEO](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MYDAL2_M_AER_OD). Use data of 8 days. Put the PNG files into a folder named OpticalThickness8Days.
- Create a KML file with aerosol optical thickness data with opacity set to 0xbf.
  ```
  ./neo_png_merger.py -i ../data/OpticalThickness8Days -o out_2011_aerosol -p bf
  ```
- Download rainfall data from [NEO] (https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=TRMM_3B43M). Choose one day out of every 8 days. Put the PNG files into a folder named E_DAYS.
- Create a KML file with rainfall data with opacity set to 0x6f.
  ```
  ./neo_png_merger.py -i ../data/E_DAYS -o out_2011_rain_8d -p 6f
  ```


#### Overlay the KML files for data layer 1 and 2 in Google Earth
- Load volcano2011.kml, out_2011_aerosol.kml and out_2011_rain_8d.kml in Google Earth.
- Set the desired time to play in timeline toolbar.
- Observe the relation between event and aerosol data and rainfall data.

## Results

For example, we can display the aerosol data, rain data and volcano eruption events during 2011 all together. The results looks like the following video.
