# 2017 Nasa Space Challenge Hackathon

## Challenge
### [Every Cloud](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/warning-danger-ahead/every-cloud/details)
Map severe weather conditions with the presence of local atmospheric aerosols to identify potential connections!

## Solution
We created a platform to display [NEO](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/ftp.php) data and events from other sources.

For example, we can display the aerosol data, rain data and volcano eruption events during 2011 all together. The results looks like the following video.
